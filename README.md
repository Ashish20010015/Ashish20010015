### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ashish Kumar Nayak, and I'm a student at C.V. Raman Global University in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I'm presently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering. A remarkable CGPA of 8.76, which reflects my devotion and commitment to greatness, has distinguished my academic experience.

I've actively sought out opportunities to apply my academic knowledge in real-world situations during my time in school, which has lead me to fulfilling internships at the Edunet Foundation and the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. I became well-versed in database management system nuances at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, where I implemented Oracle Enterprise Manager and Database Control to efficiently simplify operations. I became more proficient in sophisticated PL/SQL programming and database administration as a result of this experience.

I experimented with data analytics while working at Edunet Foundation, taking on the responsibilities of a data analytics intern. I conducted an analysis and retrieved meaningful insights from complicated datasets using Python, machine learning methods, and Microsoft Power BI. This culminated in a study that examined the Super Stores Sales Database. In addition, my own main project on Cricket Data Analytics demonstrated my ability to work with programs such as VS Code, JupyterNoteBook, and Power BI. I used data from the T20 World Cup to create analyses of the top 11 players.

Having my research paper on monkeypox illness detection using deep transfer learning models accepted for presentation at the IEEE conference is one of my major accomplishments. This demonstrates my love for cutting-edge research and my commitment to making a significant contribution to the subject.

Technically speaking, I know how to use Linux environments like Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux, and I am skilled in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL. I have a solid grasp of cloud computing platforms like AWS and Azure and am well-versed in developer tools like VS Code, Apache Hadoop, and Cloudera.

In addition, I have a strong background in industry areas including robots, machine learning, and DBMS, along with cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data analytics. I have experience with database and cloud technologies such as Apache Hive, MySQL, and Oracle Database.


I take great satisfaction in having fundamental soft skills like problem-solving, leadership, cooperation, and flexibility in addition to my technical abilities. I can work well with a variety of teams and flourish in dynamic circumstances because to these attributes.

In conclusion, I consider myself to be a diligent and adaptable person who is enthusiastic about using technology to solve problems in the real world. Combining industrial experience, technological proficiency, and soft skills, I am well-positioned to make major contributions to computer science and related fields.
